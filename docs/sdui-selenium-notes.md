# LinkedIn SDUI Selenium gotchas

Full detail for the SDUI DOM/composer invariant CLAUDE.md's "Known Gotchas" only states in one
line.

## Anchors are gone

The old `urn:`, `feed-shared-*`, and `comments-comment-*` DOM anchors no longer exist. Prefer
`data-testid` / `aria-label` selectors via `find_first`/`click_first`.

## The comment composer has no `<form>`

"Submit" means clicking the Comment/Post button next to the composer (`_composer_submitted`).
The comment overflow "…" menu is hover-hidden, not click-revealed.

## The global nav is sticky — never click a composer where the previous action left it

`_focus_composer()` centers the composer first. A top-of-viewport composer has its click stolen
by the nav's `<svg>`: `ElementClickInterceptedException ... at point (x, 9)` (issue #815).

## Every composer lookup is scoped to its OWN card

`parent_element=card` — a document-wide `div[role='textbox']` returns an EARLIER post's
still-mounted composer, which is the real y=9 source AND a comment landing on the wrong post.
There is no fallback: no composer on this card = skip it (issue #876).

## Failure naming

Inline compose failures name the STEP that threw (e.g. `Inline comment post failed at focus
composer`). Step names stay quote- and digit-free so the error-tracking escalation dedup key
(see `docs/error-tracking.md`) keeps distinct steps apart instead of collapsing them into one
fingerprint.
