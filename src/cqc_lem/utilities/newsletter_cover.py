"""Newsletter cover images — the ONE place a cover is validated, stored, and generated (issue #893).

Two ways a cover gets onto an edition, and they are deliberately NOT symmetric:

- **Upload** — the author's own artwork. It is theirs, so it lands ``approved`` and is complete on
  its own: a user who never touches generation still has a working cover path.
- **AI generation** — opt-in (per newsletter via ``cover_image_auto``, or per edition from the
  review queue). A cover is a PUBLIC brand asset, so a generated one lands ``pending_review`` and
  the publish flow attaches nothing until the author approves it.

Both halves pass the same deterministic gate first (``inspect_cover_bytes``): decodable image, an
allowed format, under the byte cap, big enough to read as a LinkedIn article cover, and not
portrait. That gate is what stops a 40 KB portrait screenshot — or a generation that came back
truncated — from ever reaching the publish step; approval is the human half on top of it.

Paths are stored RELATIVE to ``assets_dir`` so they map straight onto ``/api/assets?file_name=``.
